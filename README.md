Urban.Routes Test Automation Suite

Project Name

Urban.Routes

Description

This repository contains an end-to-end test automation suite for the Urban.Routes web application. Urban.Routes is a platform that allows users to request taxi rides, add payment methods, attach order requirements (such as blankets, handkerchiefs, ice cream, etc.), and track driver assignment through a dynamic UI.

Technologies & Techniques

Node.js (JavaScript runtime)

WebdriverIO (v8) for browser automation

Mocha as the test framework

Chai (via builtâ€‘in WDIO expect)

WDIO Services & Plugins

Service: @wdio/local-runner, @wdio/devtools-service, etc.

Plugins: network interception (wdio-intercept-service)

Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable selectors and actions

Dynamic waiting strategies:

waitForDisplayed, waitUntil, scrollIntoView to handle async UI updates

JavaScript execution for complex fields (e.g., custom card input)

Network interception to capture and assert payloads (e.g., phone verification code)

CSS Selector techniques:

ID selectors (#id)

Attribute selectors

:nth-of-type, :checked pseudo-classes

Scoped hierarchy selectors for deeply nested elements
